- organizations & teams

## Repos

- remote-repositories 
- cloning vs forking
- tracking changes
- commits
- main/local
- branches
- merges

## Issues

- this is where the organization & development happens

## Pull-Requests

- at some point consolidation of work needs to happen

## Teams and Code Review

- teams for sub-components of larger projects
- teams in classroom
- programmatic system of team organization

## Version Control for Open Science

- MNE
- FieldTrip

# Webpages and Wikis
