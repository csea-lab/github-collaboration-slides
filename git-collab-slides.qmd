# Git

## A History of Git {.smaller}

- Invented by Linus Torvalds in 2005 <br> for maintenence of Linux kernel
- *Git* - an idiom meaning idiot or fool
- Complexity required for remote and local tracking of changes
  
*Goals of the Git version control system (VCS)*:  
  
- Speed
- Simple design
- Strong support for non-linear development (thousands of parallel branches)
- Fully distributed
- Able to handle large projects like the Linux kernel efficiently (speed and data size)

## Why use Git?

- Analogy: turn tracking-changes `on` in Word document
- Antipattern: revision auto-saving w/ time-stamp

- Solutions for continuous <br> merging of sets of changes

## How to use Git {.smaller}

- Three States
   - *Modified* means that you have changed the file <br> but have not committed it to your database yet.
   - *Staged* means that you have marked a modified file <br> to go into your next commit snapshot.
   - *Committed* means data is safely stored in local database.

## Key Featureof Git: Timeline Control 

![](reachability-example.png)

::: {.notes}

You can think of this graph as a set of three parallel universes with time flowing from left to right, so that A is the beginning of recorded history. (The arrow represents the "follows" or "is subsequent to" relationship, so you might say that "B follows A".)

:::

## Key Featureof Git: Timeline Control 

![](reachability-exampleE.jpg)


## Key Featureof Git: Timeline Control 

![](reachability-exampleK.jpg)

::: {.notes}

- If you start from E, the history you'll see is A, B, C, D, E.

:::

## Key Featureof Git: Timeline Control 

![](reachability-exampleH.jpg)


::: {.notes}
- If you start from K, the history you'll see is A, B, C, I, J, K.
But the really important thing about this is that no matter which node you start with, some **parts of the graph will be unreachable** to you.  

*turn it around*: **Depending** on where you start, you can **reach parts** of the graph that you couldn't get to otherwise.

## Repositories

You typically obtain a Git repository in one of two ways:  
- Initializing a Repository  
- Cloning an Existing Repository  

# GitHub

## GitHub
- *Analogy*: Similar to Dropbox except sync timing
- *Antipattern*: Dropbox has no system to entertain +1 versions
- One variant of remote-repository hosting including: 
   - BitBucket, GitLab, Sourceforge 
- Extensive documentation and additional online features
- Project organization tools: Projects, wikis, webpages
- Security: public vs private (e.g., access-control & 2FA)
   - Private: organizations, teams, assignees
   - Public: oocial tools, watching, fork-ing

## Getting Started with GH Desktop

[GHD](https://desktop.github.com)

[Github Desktop Setup](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/overview/creating-your-first-repository-using-github-desktop#part-1-installing-github-desktop-and-authenticating-your-account)

![](GHDesktop.png)

## Issues

This is where the organization of development begins  

- `@` mention collaborators
- `#` followed by issue title, links related issues in repository
- Create and assign new branch for issue (When pull-request; issue closed?)


::: aside

https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue
https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-a-branch-for-an-issue
:::

::: {.notes}

When you mention an issue in another issue or pull request, the issue's timeline reflects the cross-reference so that you can keep track of related work. To indicate that work is in progress, you can link an issue to a pull request. When the pull request merges, the linked issue automatically closes.

::: 

## Discussions 

Use GitHub Repository Discussions to:   

- ask and answer questions
- share information
- make announcements
- conduct or participate in <br> conversations about a project

## Repos

- remote-repositories 
- cloning vs forking
- tracking changes
- commits
- main/local
- branches
- merges 

## Pull-Requests

- at some point consolidation of work needs to happen

## Writing Manuscripts

## Flow Diagrams

## Teams and Code Review {.smaller}

- Teams for sub-components of larger projects
- Teams for super-group for several repos
- Groups in classrooms
- Packages to arrange <br> members & organization
